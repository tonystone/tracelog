/// A FileOutputStream is an abstraction similar to a FileHandle
/// that represents the Output portion of the full file handle
/// interface.  At this writing TraceLog only requires writing of
/// files therefore, only the output portion was implemented.
///
/// - Remark: Why note just use `Foundation.FileHandle`?  We found
///           that the FileHandle implementation at this writing is
///           not suitable for TraceLog's stringent fault tolerance
///           requirements.  The current implementation of the
///           FileHandle.write function, and others, call `FatalError()`
///           (crashing your app) if any error is encountered when
///           writing to the file.  This is not acceptable behavior
///           so we wrote our own implementation so that TraceLog can
///           recover gracefully when writes and other operations fail.
